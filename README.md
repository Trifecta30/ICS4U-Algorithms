What did I learn about algorithms
- Algorithms have virtual as well as tangeble real life aplications even if they are simplistic.

How did i know it was algorithmic
- it was repeatable which showed that it was a pattern which is pretty much the basic principle of math which is the base of all algorithms.

What is an algorithm to me
- an algorithm is a repeatable mathimatical process/pattern that can be executed by a computer and, since people are are pretty much computers on a different operating system and with different functionality, it can be executed by humans as well if only at a different effort level and different time span if given the right tools.
